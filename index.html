      <p>
        My name is Owen Wilkins and I am a 1st Semester, 2nd Term Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. So far I have been enjoy many of my classes and have been noticing my skills improving. I decided to go to school for Graphic Design as I had been a designer through most of my elementary and high-school years, creating basic things like custom presentation slide layouts as well as having a love of art. These things pushed me towards the Program where I hoped to improve these skills to a professional level. I have experienced a fair amount of coding during high-school, mainly in the languages Python and JavaScript. I am excited to learn more about design focused coding in this course.

        Outside of school I enjoy playing games and talking with friends, reading sci-fi books, and interacting with online communities like twich. My favourite seaon is winter as I am a fan of the longer nights when I am most productive, and the colder days. As I often tell people <q>You can always put on more layers when it gets colder, but there are only so many You can take off when it gets too warm.</q> 03, 11, and 13 are my favourite numbers as I have fun connections to each of them. If I had to choose a favourite food it would probably be Gyro's or Spicy Curry.
